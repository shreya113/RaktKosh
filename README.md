# RaktKosh


RaktKosh is based on the idea to cater the need of people running here and there in emergency requirement of blood.
People have to contact a lot of people and hospitals in search of blood. 
And if blood is not made available timely it can cost the life of the patient.
In RaktKosh, the user can search for the blood type and the quantity in which he needs the blood.
A list of nearby hospitals having that blood will be available for the person to reach out.
